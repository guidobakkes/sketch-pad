Sketch Pad
==========

This is an exercise for TheOdinProject. The goal is to create a sketch pad with JavaScript/jQuery.

## Exercise guidelines
In this project, you'll get a chance to actually build a pretty nifty tool to flex your Javascript and jQuery muscles. Up until now, you've had your hand held quite a bit by Codecademy. Now it's time to do it on your own. You're going to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

This should NOT be trivially easy for you. You'll probably have to Google frequently to get the right jQuery methods or CSS to use. In fact, that's the point! You CAN build this, and the resources are out there. We'll walk through the basic steps but it'll be up to you to find out how to actually implement them. For instance, where does a hover effect come from?

The key is to break it down into little manageable steps and then figure out how to solve each step in turn.

If you get totally stuck, solutions from other students are listed below. I'd encourage you to struggle for a bit on your own before checking them out.
